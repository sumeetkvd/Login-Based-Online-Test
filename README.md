# Login-Based-Online-Test
The goal of this Linux Shell Scripting Project is to implement a login based online test platform using BASH Shell and commands.


(1). Provide a prompt for the user to sign-up and sign-in:
	Sign In
		Take Test
		View Test
	Sign up
	Exit

(2). Using sign-up, the user can register with a user-id and password, and we ask for username. The username should contain only alphanumeric symbols and when this condition is not matched, they again ask for a new password. 

(3). The password can contain any symbol in it. Accept at least eight characters with at least a number and symbol ask the user to re-enter the password again for validation already registered user can sign-in with ID and password.

(4). The script should prompt for username and password, the password should be like a shadow password and show error in-case passwords mismatches.
